Climate Change Using NLP
# Climate Change Public Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes public sentiment on climate change using comments collected from NASA's official Facebook page dedicated to climate change discussions. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract insights from user comments and track sentiment trends over time.

## Project Overview

Climate change is a critical global issue, and public opinion plays a vital role in shaping awareness and policy actions. This project uses NLP to analyze over 500 user comments from NASAâ€™s Facebook posts (2020-2023) to:

- Perform **sentiment analysis** on user comments.
- Identify **trends in public sentiment** over time.
- Understand user engagement patterns.
- Extract common themes using **topic modeling**.
